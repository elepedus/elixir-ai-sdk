# Test-Driven Development Guide for Porting Vercel AI SDK to Elixir

This document provides a structured approach for porting functionality from the Vercel AI SDK (TypeScript) to an Elixir implementation using strict test-driven development.

## Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis

1. **Select Feature to Port**: 
   - Review available features in Vercel AI SDK
   - Confirm feature is not already implemented in the Elixir SDK
   - Assess complexity and dependencies of the chosen feature

2. **Extract Vercel Implementation Details**:
   - Locate source files containing the feature implementation
   - Identify core interfaces, types, and functions
   - Note dependencies and relationships between components
   - Document the feature's API surface

3. **Map TypeScript Concepts to Elixir**:
   - Create a mapping between TypeScript types and Elixir structs/types
   - Plan how to translate functional patterns to Elixir
   - Determine appropriate Elixir conventions to follow

## Phase 2: Test-Driven Development

4. **Create a Test Plan**:
   - Analyze existing tests in Vercel SDK
   - Document test cases covering critical functionality 
   - Organize test cases in logical progression from simple to complex
   - Include test scenarios for edge cases and error handling

5. **Single-Test TDD Cycle**:
   - Write exactly ONE test case at a time
   - Run the test to confirm it fails (RED phase)
   - Implement minimal code to make this specific test pass
   - Run the test to verify it passes (GREEN phase)
   - Refactor code for clarity while keeping test passing
   - Only move to the next test after current test passes

6. **Progressive Implementation**:
   - Follow the test plan sequence, implementing one test at a time
   - Each new test builds on previously implemented functionality
   - Never implement code without a failing test driving it
   - Handle edge cases and error conditions as separate test cases
   - Run the entire test suite after each implementation to ensure regression protection

7. **Documentation During Implementation**:
   - Document each function as you implement it
   - Add module documentation after completing related test cases
   - Include inline comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation when refactoring

## Phase 3: Integration and Documentation

8. **Integrate with Existing Codebase**:
   - Connect implementation to existing functionality
   - Ensure error handling is consistent with the rest of the codebase
   - Update any dependent modules to use the new functionality

9. **Document the Implementation**:
   - Add module and function documentation using ExDoc conventions
   - Include example usage in the documentation
   - Update relevant README sections
   - Consider adding example code to demonstrate usage

10. **Create Usage Examples**:
    - Develop simple examples showing how to use the feature
    - Include examples in tests and documentation
    - Compare usage pattern with original Vercel SDK for consistency

## Example: Porting Tool Calling Functionality

For tool calling functionality specifically:

### Feature Analysis

The tool calling functionality in Vercel AI SDK allows:
- Defining tools with specific parameters and execution logic
- Tools can be regular functions or provider-defined
- Validating tool call arguments against schemas
- Executing tool calls and handling results
- Error handling for invalid tool calls

### Test Plan for Tool Calling

1. **Basic Tool Definition Tests:**
   - Test creating a basic function tool
   - Test creating a tool with an execute function
   - Test creating a provider-defined tool

2. **Tool Parameter Validation Tests:**
   - Test validation of correct parameters
   - Test validation failure with missing parameters
   - Test validation failure with incorrect parameter types

3. **Tool Execution Tests:**
   - Test successful tool execution
   - Test tool execution with error handling
   - Test tool execution with async results

4. **Integration with GenerateText Tests:**
   - Test generating text with tools available to the model
   - Test handling model-generated tool calls
   - Test sending tool results back to the model
   - Test multi-turn conversations with tool usage

### Implementation Structure

```
lib/ai/core/tool/
  └── tool.ex              # Core tool definition
  └── tool_call.ex         # Tool call handling
  └── tool_result.ex       # Tool result processing
  └── parse_tool_call.ex   # Logic for parsing tool calls
```

Each test should be implemented individually, following the red-green-refactor cycle, before moving to the next test.

## Elixir Conventions to Follow

- Use structs for complex data types
- Follow Elixir naming conventions (snake_case)
- Use pattern matching for function dispatch
- Implement proper error handling using {:ok, result} and {:error, reason} tuples
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use appropriate typespecs for all public functions
- Document all modules and public functions
